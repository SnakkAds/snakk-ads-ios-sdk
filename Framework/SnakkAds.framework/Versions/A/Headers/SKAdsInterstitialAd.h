 An ad object may unload its content for a number of reasons, including such cases as when an error occurs, after a user dismisses
 an advertisement that was presented modally or after an advertisement’s contents have been loaded for a long period of time.
 The ad object automatically removes its contents from the screen if it was already presented to the user.
 Your implementation of this method should release the ad object.

/**
 Called before a banner view executes an action.
 
 @param interstitialAd The full-screen ad that the user tapped.
 @param willLeave YES if another application will be launched to execute the action; NO if the action is going to be executed inside your appliaction.
 
 @return Your delegate returns YES if the banner action should execute; NO to prevent the banner action from executing.
 
 When the user taps a presented advertisement, the ad’s delegate is called to inform your application that the user wants to interact with the ad.
 To allow the action to be triggered, your method should return YES; to suppress the action, your method returns NO. Your application should almost
 always allow actions to be triggered; preventing actions may alter the advertisements your application sees and reduce the revenue your application earns through TapIt! by Phunware.
 
 If the value of the willLeave parameter is YES and your delegate allows the advertisement to execute its action, then your application is moved to
 the background shortly after the call to this method completes.
 
 If the value of the willLeave parameter is NO, the advertisement’s interactive experience will run inside your application. To accomodate the advertisement,
 your application should disable activities that require user interaction as well as disabling any tasks or behaviors that may interfere with the advertisement.
 For example, a game might pause its game play and turn off sound effects until the user finishes interacting with the advertisement. Further, while the
 action is running, your application should also be prepared to respond to low-memory warnings by disposing of objects it can easily recreate after the
 advertisement completes its action.
